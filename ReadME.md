# ACl Mapper

In Active Directory Env ACL (Access Control List) are used to specify what object(User,Computer or Group) has permission over what object. However there are tons and tons of ACL assigned to every Object that is 
present in the AD env, Which get difficult to understand and analysis the misconfigured/Over permissive ACL. 

Thus ACL Map will help you identify these misconfigured/ Over permissive ACL and give you an simple report where you can understand and Fix it before an attacker could exploit it.
